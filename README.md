# Credit Card Defaults in Taiwan

## About
In this example, we will explore a dataset that contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

This dataset was obtained from the University of California, Irvine archives.

## Project Goals
### Goal 1:
Employ exploratory data analysis techniques on the data set.
### Goal 2:
Run a logistical regression to predict the probability of a client defaulting on their next month's credit card payment.
### Goal 3:
Run a simple PCA "Principal Component Analysis" on the data and check how the first 5 PCs load all the variables.
### Goal 4:
Run a K-means cluster on the data with k = 4, and plot the chart with variables limit_bal and bill_amt. Briefly explain the 4 clusters in the chart.
