# Credit Card Defaults in Taiwan

## About
In this example, we will explore a dataset that contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

This dataset was obtained from the University of California, Irvine archives.

## Project Goals
### Goal 1:
Employ exploratory data analysis techniques on the data set.
### Goal 2:
Run a logistical regression to predict the probability of a new credit card client defaulting on their next month's credit card payment.
### Goal 3:
Run a simple PCA "Principal Component Analysis" on the data and check how the first 5 PCs load all the variables.
### Goal 4:
Run a K-means cluster on the data with k = 4, and plot the chart with variables limit_bal and bill_amt. Briefly explain the 4 clusters in the chart.

## Conclusion

The Default of Credit Card Clients data set allowed us to practice key data skills. 
The first was _**data acquisition**_, by obtaining and importing our data into RStudio.
The second was _**data preparation**_, by cleaning and manipulating the variables within the data set to prepare for the analytics portion of the project.
The third was the _**data analytics**_ phase, using statistics, logistical regression, and predictive models to uncover insights into our dependent and independent variables.
the last data skill we practiced was _**data visualization**_, by creating charts and graphs throughout the project to better portray what was happening within the data.
